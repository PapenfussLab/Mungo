     export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/python/mungo

----------

Patterns & other interesting features:
- Munging data structure for rapid development
- Data file iteration and index file creation
- Visualization
- natural interface

Why not biopython?
- unnatural
- poorly documented
- often overly complicated
